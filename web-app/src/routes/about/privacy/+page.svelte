<h2 id="inforetain">4. How Long Do We Keep Your Information</h2>

<p>
	<strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
	outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
</p>

<p>
	We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set
	out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such
	as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us
	keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an
	account with us.
</p>

<p>
	When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
	either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
	your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
	personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>

<h2 id="infosafe">5. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe</h2>

	<strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational
	and technical security measures.

	designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
	safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
	information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
	guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
	defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
	will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
	from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure

	minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
	information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
	account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
	aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
	pubgolf+legal@thedeerchild.com.
</p>

<h2 id="privacyrights">7. What Are Your Privacy Rights</h2>

	information, you also have the right to complain to your <a
		href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"
		>Member State data protection authority</a
	>

	If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a
		href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html"
		>Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a
	>.
</p>

<p id="withdrawconsent">
	<strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your
	personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law,
	you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time
	by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
	<a href="#contact">"how can you contact us about this notice?"</a> below.
</p>

<p>
	However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
	withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
	information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from
	our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in

	and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

	If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
	pubgolf+legal@thedeerchild.com.

<h2 id="DNT">8. Controls For Do Not Track Features</h2>

<p>
	Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
	("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
	about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
	standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
	currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
	your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
	follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
	notice.
</p>

<h2 id="caresidents">9. Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights</h2>

	behalf.
</p>

<h4>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</h4>

<p>
	We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written

	processes the information on our behalf, following the same strict privacy protection obligations
	mandated by the CCPA.
</p>

<p>
	We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking
	internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be
	"selling" of your personal information.
</p>

<p>
	Eric Morris has not disclosed, sold, or shared any personal information to third parties for a
	business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. Eric Morris will not sell or

	You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal
	information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain
	exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his

<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>

<ul>
	<li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>

	<li>the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.</li>

<p>
	In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information

<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

<h5>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</h5>

<h5>Verification process</h5>

<p>
	Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same
	person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to
	ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously
	provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide
	certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we
	already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
	that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
	circumstances dictate.
</p>

<p>
	We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
	authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
	information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
	from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
	information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
	purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
	you.
</p>

<h5>Other privacy rights</h5>

<ul>
	<li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
	<li>
		You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or
		ask to restrict the processing of the information.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may
		deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly
		authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third
		parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly
		possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
	</li>
</ul>
